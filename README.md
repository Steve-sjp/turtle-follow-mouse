# Python "Turtle", that follows your mouse
___
I made this script for the school python class, hopefully this script will make easier all the work in this class, because I can draw something I need, and then just copy all the actions from the terminal. 
___
Functions of my script:
* The **Turtle** go to the mouse click position.
* The **Turtle** looks in correct direction.
* The **Turtle** leaves coordinates and other actions in:
  * window title
  * terminal (console)
  * playground
* You can put mouse up and down using mouse wheel.
